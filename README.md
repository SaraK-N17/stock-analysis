# Stock Analysis

## Analysis of Stocks for Steve

## Purpose
Provide analysis of Steve's stock data from 2017 and 2018. Steve would like to advise his parents which stock options are most likely to be profitable. With VBA, we can select a specific year's data in Excel easily to quickly provide comparisons. Refactoring the VBA meant a faster result when the macro was run.
